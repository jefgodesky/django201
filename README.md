## Django 201 Project

This is my project for [Kalob Taulien](https://www.skillshare.com/en/user/kalobtaulien)'s
[Django 201](https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/Django-201-Intermediate-Django-Development/2058959827)
course on [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com).
I've written about the
importance of avoiding tightly-coupled
Javascript and Ajax like that seen in this
repository in favor of [progressive enhancement](https://blog.bitsrc.io/a-practical-guide-to-progressive-enhancement-in-2023-52c740c3aff3)
elsewhere, and I plan on writing an
article in the future about the deep
problems with Tailwind. Suffice to say, the
code in this repository is not up to my
personal standards of quality, and does
not reflect my standards or values as a
developer. They were part of the class,
which was focused on learning Django
specifically. I plan to soon be adding new
repositories that use Django in a way
that is test-driven with solid
semantic markup, progressive enhancement,
and good software engineering practices.
